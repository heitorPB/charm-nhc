    'TORQUE, Slurm, and other schedulers/resource managers provide for a periodic
    "node health check" to be performed on each compute node to verify that the
    node is working properly. Nodes which are determined to be "unhealthy"
    can be marked as down or offline so as to prevent jobs from being scheduled or
    run on them. This helps increase the reliability and throughput of a cluster
    by reducing preventable job failures due to misconfiguration, hardware failure, etc.'
